# Online Calculator

Odin Project Assignment : [Calculator](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)

Final project of *Foundations course*. 

Main goal: Combine everything I have learned on JavaScript, HTML, CSS and programming mentality in general.

## Assignment 
Calculator will store 3 variables: first number, operatio, second number. Calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. For example, this is how your calculator should function entering the sequence "12", "+", "1" "*", "3":

1. Enter a number (12).
2. Enter an operator (+).
3. Enter a second number (1).
4. Enter a second operator (*). At this point, it should evaluate the initial pair of numbers (12 + 1), then display the result (13).
5. Enter another number (3).
6. Enter another operator or equals sign (=). At this point, it should use the previous result (13) as the first number, the operator (*), and the new number (3) to calculate the new equation 13 * 3. You should see the result (39) on the display.
